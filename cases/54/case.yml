  请画一张极其平凡无奇的iPhone 自拍照，没有明确的主体或构图感，就像是随手一拍的快照。照片略带运动模糊，阳光或店内灯光不均导致轻微曝光过度。角度尴尬、构图混乱，整体呈现出一种刻意的平庸感-就像是从口袋里拿手机时不小心拍到的一张自拍。主角是陈奕迅和谢霆锋，晚上，旁边是香港会展中心，在香港维多利亚港旁边。

  Please draw an extremely ordinary and unremarkable iPhone selfie, with no clear subject or sense of composition — just like a random snapshot taken casually. The photo should include slight motion blur, with uneven lighting caused by sunlight or indoor lights resulting in mild overexposure. The angle is awkward, the composition is messy, and the overall aesthetic is deliberately plain — as if it was accidentally taken while pulling the phone out of a pocket.
  The subjects are Eason Chan and Nicholas Tse, taken at night, next to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, by Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong.
