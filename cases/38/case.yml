  创作一张手绘风格的信息图卡片，比例为9:16竖版。卡片主题鲜明，背景为带有纸质肌理的米色或米白色，整体设计体现质朴、亲切的手绘美感。

  卡片上方以红黑相间、对比鲜明的大号毛笔草书字体突出标题，吸引视觉焦点。文字内容均采用中文草书，整体布局分为2至4个清晰的小节，每节以简短、精炼的中文短语表达核心要点。字体保持草书流畅的韵律感，既清晰可读又富有艺术气息。周边适当留白。

  卡片中点缀简单、有趣的手绘插画或图标，例如人物或象征符号，以增强视觉吸引力，引发读者思考与共鸣。整体布局注意视觉平衡，预留足够的空白空间，确保画面简洁明了，易于阅读和理解。

  Create a hand-drawn style infographic card in a 9:16 vertical format. The card should have a clear theme, with a beige or off-white paper-textured background. The overall design should reflect a simple, warm, and handmade aesthetic.

  At the top of the card, use large, eye-catching brush-style Chinese cursive calligraphy in red and black for the title, creating strong visual contrast. All text should be in Chinese cursive script. The layout should be divided into 2 to 4 clear sections, each conveying a core idea through concise and refined Chinese phrases. The calligraphy should maintain a fluid, rhythmic style that is both legible and artistically expressive. Leave appropriate blank space around the text.

  The card should be accented with simple and fun hand-drawn illustrations or icons — such as figures or symbolic elements — to enhance visual appeal and spark thought or emotional resonance. The overall layout should emphasize visual balance and include ample whitespace, ensuring the design is clean, clear, and easy to read.

  “Building a personal brand (IP) is long-term compounding.
