  A delicate crystal ball rests quietly on a warm, softly lit tabletop by the window. The background is blurred and hazy, with warm-toned sunlight gently passing through the crystal ball, refracting specks of golden light that softly illuminate the dim surroundings.
  Inside the crystal ball, a miniature three-dimensional world themed around {Chang’e Flying to the Moon} is naturally displayed — a finely detailed, dreamlike 3D scene. All characters and objects are rendered in adorable chibi style, exquisitely crafted and visually charming, with vivid emotional interactions between them.
  The overall atmosphere is rich with East Asian fantasy elements, full of intricate details and a surreal magical realism texture. The entire scene feels poetic and dreamy, luxurious yet elegant, radiating a gentle, comforting glow — as if imbued with life through the warm play of light and shadow.
