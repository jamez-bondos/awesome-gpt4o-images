  Transform the two people in the photo into chibi-style 3D cartoon characters, dressed in traditional Chinese wedding attire. The overall theme is a festive red Chinese-style wedding. The background features a decorative “囍” (double happiness) paper-cut pattern in a classic folk style. 
  Clothing (realistic texture, traditional details):
  Male: Wearing a red changpao and magua (traditional robe and jacket) embroidered with golden dragon motifs, symbolizing nobility and grandeur. A large red flower is tied on his chest, representing celebration and good fortune.
  Female: Dressed in a red xiuhe wedding gown adorned with exquisite golden floral and phoenix embroidery, showcasing elegance and luxury. She wears delicate floral hair ornaments to enhance her gentle and graceful appearance.
  Headwear:
  Male: A traditional red zhuangyuan (scholar) hat with golden patterns and a refined golden ornament at the top, exuding classic scholarly dignity.
  Female: A phoenix crown adorned with a central red flower, gold 3D decorative elements, and hanging tassels—luxurious and full of classical charm.
  This image should reflect the joy and blessing of a traditional Chinese wedding, with realistic textures for costumes and accessories, combined with stylized 3D chibi characters.
