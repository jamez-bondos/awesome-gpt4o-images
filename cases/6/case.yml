  照片中的角色的 3D Q 版形象穿过传送门，牵着观众的手，在将观众拉向前时动态地回头一看。传送门外的背景是观众的现实世界，一个典型的程序员的书房，有书桌，显示器和笔记本电脑，传送门内是角色所处的3D Q 版世界，细节可以参考照片，整体呈蓝色调，和现实世界形成鲜明对比。传送门散发着神秘的蓝色和紫色色调，是两个世界之间的完美椭圆形框架处在画面中间。从第三人称视角拍摄的摄像机角度，显示观看者的手被拉入角色世界。2：3 的宽高比。

  A 3D chibi-style version of the person in the photo is stepping through a glowing portal, reaching out and holding the viewer’s hand. As the character pulls the viewer forward, they turn back with a dynamic glance, inviting the viewer into their world.
  Behind the portal is the viewer’s real-life environment: a typical programmer’s study with a desk, monitor, and laptop, rendered in realistic detail. Inside the portal lies the character’s 3D chibi world, inspired by the photo, with a cool blue color scheme that sharply contrasts with the real-world surroundings.
  The portal itself is a perfectly elliptical frame glowing with mysterious blue and purple light, positioned at the center of the image as a gateway between the two worlds.
  The scene is captured from a third-person perspective, clearly showing the viewer’s hand being pulled into the character’s world. Use a 2:3 aspect ratio.
