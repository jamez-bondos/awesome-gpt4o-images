  《大师麦片》：根据我上传的照片的人物特征判断，为他生成一个符合他特质的燕麦片搭配（比如蔬菜、水果、酸奶、粗粮等等）和包装设计，然后生成他作为麦片包装盒封面人物 加 相应麦片搭配的广告封面，人物要保持特征、可爱Q版3d、c4d渲染风格，麦片所放置的地方的风格也要符合设定，比如放在厨房、超市 极简主义的设计台上等等，先做好设定，再生成图像。

  “Master Oats”: Based on the visual features of the person in the uploaded photo, generate a custom oatmeal mix that reflects their personality traits — for example, using vegetables, fruits, yogurt, whole grains, etc.

  Design a unique cereal box and package aesthetic that aligns with this tailored mix.

  Then, create an advertising cover featuring the person as the mascot on the cereal box. The character should retain their recognizable features but be transformed into a cute chibi-style 3D figure with a C4D-quality rendering.

  The oatmeal and packaging should be presented in a setting that matches the mood — such as a minimalist kitchen, a sleek supermarket display, or a clean design counter.

  The process includes:
  – Character analysis and oat mix pairing
  – Cereal box concept and design
  – Display environment selection
  – Final image with mascot figure, packaging, and styled scene composition

  All visuals should be balanced, modern, and appealing, reflecting a premium and fun oat brand identity.
