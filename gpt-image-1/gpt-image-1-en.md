The 40 examples below are curated directly from [OpenAI‚Äôs Official Image Generation Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation) and showcase the five core features of the gpt-image-1 model:
- ‚úÖ More accurate, high fidelity images
- üé® Diverse visual styles
- ‚úèÔ∏è Precise image editing
- üåé Rich world knowledge
- üî§ Consistent text rendering

OpenAI official examples are not covered by this repository‚Äôs CC BY 4.0 license (see the corresponding NOTICE file for details).

*Note: Both `gpt-image-1` and GPT-4o are OpenAI's latest image generation products, supported by largely the same underlying models. The main difference is that the former is currently accessed via API, while the latter powers official products like ChatGPT and Sora. `gpt-image-1` represents the newer iteration available through the API.*

### Example 26: Fantasy Dreamscape Environment

<img src="./examples/game-design.png" width="300" alt="Fantasy Dreamscape Environment">

**Prompt:**
```
In a sprawling ancient forest illuminated by the golden hues of a low-hanging twilight sun, a wide clearing opens into a surreal dreamscape that seems to blend fantasy and forgotten mythology. At the heart of this clearing stands an enormous, weathered tree with a trunk as wide as a small house and bark etched with glowing, ancient runes pulsating faintly in shades of aquamarine and violet. The tree‚Äôs branches stretch skyward like arms, covered in bioluminescent leaves that shimmer in a gradient of emerald green to sapphire blue, flickering gently as if breathing with the rhythm of the earth itself. Around the base of the tree lies a circular pool of crystalline water, unnaturally still, reflecting not just the tree above it, but also constellations that don‚Äôt exist in our sky‚Äîstars shaped like animals, celestial figures, and mysterious glyphs. A narrow stone path, cracked and overgrown with moss and delicate glowing fungi, leads from the edge of the forest to the pool, lined with floating lanterns suspended in midair without any visible support, each encasing a softly glowing flame of a different color. Along the edges of the forest clearing, the trees seem to lean inward, their trunks twisted like ancient dancers, and their leaves whispering secrets in a wind that can be heard but not felt. Tall stalks of silvery grass sway under the influence of a phantom breeze, and clusters of flowers with translucent petals release faint motes of light into the air, like floating pollen that sparkles and twirls as it rises upward. To the right of the tree, a grand stone arch partially buried in vines stands like a portal, its frame adorned with sculpted reliefs of mythical creatures: winged wolves, twin-tailed phoenixes, and enormous turtles with cities on their backs. Beyond the arch shimmers a misty threshold, behind which lies the suggestion of an entirely different realm‚Äîits colors slightly more saturated, its sky a strange teal hue with three moons visible in the clouds. A lone traveler stands before this arch, cloaked in flowing robes of deep indigo lined with stardust thread, their hood down to reveal glowing eyes that mirror the reflection in the pool. They carry a long, ornate staff, topped with a cluster of floating crystals that orbit one another slowly, humming with magic. Ahead of the traveler is a small floating companion creature, resembling a cross between a jellyfish and a hummingbird, with translucent wings and tendrils that pulse in rhythm with the traveler‚Äôs heartbeat. In the sky above, the clouds swirl in painterly strokes of lavender and peach, pierced occasionally by rays of sunlight that look more like golden waterfalls descending from the heavens. Several large, floating islands drift lazily through the air, each one covered in its own miniature ecosystem: one holds a temple ruin with hanging gardens spilling over its cliffs, another is blanketed in snow and ice with a glowing aurora snaking above it, and yet another contains a small lake with inverted waterfalls that flow upward into the sky. Flocks of gigantic birds with opalescent feathers circle around these islands, their wings leaving shimmering trails behind them as if tearing through the fabric of reality. Occasionally, one can spot a flying whale in the distance, its skin like polished stone, adorned with runes that light up when it sings its deep, resonant song that echoes through the clouds. Closer to the ground, mythical animals roam freely. A unicorn made of mist sips from the crystal pool, its reflection showing a completely different creature‚Äîa shadowy stag with fiery antlers. Nearby, a fox with an ethereal tail lounges atop a moss-covered rock, each tail flickering with a different element‚Äîflame, water, ice, lightning, smoke, shadow, wind, light, and crystal. Mushrooms with tiny eyes peek from under leaves, while trees occasionally blink as if watching the scene unfold. A choir of unseen voices hums an otherworldly melody that resonates with the air, causing particles of light to float upward in gentle spirals, like visualized sound. In the background, barely visible beyond the treeline, towers rise in the distance, seemingly grown from the land rather than built‚Äîcrystalline spires twisted like seashells, glowing from within and surrounded by spiraling rings of floating stone. Between them, serpentine dragons fly in lazy arcs, their scales reflecting the shifting colors of the sky, and their breath leaving trails of fog in the air. Every few moments, a ripple of magic pulses through the land, subtly shifting the hues and lighting of the entire environment, as if the world is being constantly re-rendered in real time by an unseen painter. This entire scene exists in a liminal space‚Äîneither day nor night, neither real nor imagined, a fusion of the magical and the natural, the fantastical and the familiar. The palette of the image should include deeply saturated jewel tones for the magical elements‚Äîsapphire, emerald, amethyst, and ruby‚Äîwhile the natural elements lean toward warm dusk tones‚Äîburnished orange, soft pink, and rich earth brown. The overall composition should feel painterly yet hyper-detailed, with textures that could be touched and lighting that changes dynamically across the image, creating depth, contrast, and a sense of wonder. Everything should feel alive: light sources flicker and shift, plants gently sway, and magical energy crackles faintly in the air.
